Step 1: Analyze the Physical Meaning
The equation z = z_0 - k * x^2 represents the "Envelope of Safety"—the outer boundary of all possible trajectories. We are not looking for one specific path, but the limits of all paths.

We can find the constants by identifying two critical edge cases on this boundary:
1. The maximum possible height (z_max) where x = 0.
2. The maximum possible range (x_max) where z = 0.

Step 2: Find z_0 (The Peak)
The maximum height is achieved by throwing the ball straight up (theta = 90).
Using energy conservation (mgh = 1/2 mv^2):
z_0 = v_0^2 / (2g)

Step 3: Find k (The Width)
The boundary touches the ground (z = 0) at the maximum possible range.
We know max range occurs at 45 degrees:
x_max = v_0^2 / g

Now, substitute this point (z=0, x = v_0^2/g) into the boundary equation:
0 = z_0 - k * (x_max)^2
0 = (v_0^2 / 2g) - k * (v_0^2 / g)^2

Step 4: Solve for k
k * (v_0^4 / g^2) = v_0^2 / (2g)
k = (v_0^2 / 2g) * (g^2 / v_0^4)
k = g / (2 * v_0^2)

Conclusion:
z_0 = v_0^2 / (2g)
k = g / (2 * v_0^2)

Predicted Answer: z_0 = v_0^2/2g, k = g/2v_0^2  (Correct)
