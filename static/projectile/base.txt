Step 1: Write Equations of Motion
The trajectory of a single projectile is given by:
x = v0 * cos(theta) * t
z = v0 * sin(theta) * t - 0.5 * g * t^2

Eliminating t, we get the trajectory equation:
z = x * tan(theta) - (g * x^2) / (2 * v0^2 * cos^2(theta))

Step 2: Match Coefficients
We compare this specific trajectory to the given boundary equation: z = z0 - k * x^2.

To find the constants, we assume the standard case for maximums, which is theta = 45 degrees.
- At 45 degrees, tan(theta) = 1.
- At 45 degrees, cos^2(theta) = 0.5.

Step 3: Solve for k
Looking at the x^2 term in the trajectory equation:
Coefficient = g / (2 * v0^2 * cos^2(theta))
Substitute cos^2(45) = 0.5:
k = g / (2 * v0^2 * 0.5)
k = g / v0^2   <-- ERROR: Assumed boundary is defined by the 45-degree path.

Conclusion:
z_0 = v_0^2 / (2g)
k = g / v_0^2

Predicted Answer: z_0 = v_0^2/2g, k = g/v_0^2  (Incorrect k)
