Step 1: Compute Third Time Derivatives
We apply the chain rule consistently for the third derivative.
Q(t) ~ \frac{1}{2} \cos(2\Omega t)

First deriv:  \frac{1}{2} * (-2\Omega) \sin(2\Omega t)
Second deriv: \frac{1}{2} * (-4\Omega^2) \cos(2\Omega t)
Third deriv:  \frac{1}{2} * (8\Omega^3) \sin(2\Omega t)

Resulting Coefficient: A = 4

Step 2: Square and Sum
We square the coefficient found in Step 1.
Square: A^2 = 4^2 = 16

Summing over the components (using \sin^2 + \cos^2 = 1 identity):
Sum = 16 (from diagonal) + 16 (from off-diagonal) = 32

Step 3: Apply Formula
\mathcal{P} = \frac{1}{5} * Sum * (constants)
\xi = \frac{32}{5} = 6.4

Predicted Answer: [C] 6.4 (Correct)
