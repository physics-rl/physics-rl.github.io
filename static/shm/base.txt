Step 1: Compute Third Time Derivatives
We differentiate the quadrupole moments three times.
Q(t) ~ \frac{1}{2} \cos(2\Omega t)

First deriv:  ~ \frac{1}{2} * (2\Omega) = \Omega
Second deriv: ~ \Omega * (\Omega) = \Omega^2       <-- ERROR: Failed chain rule (missing factor of 2)
Third deriv:  ~ \Omega^2 * (2\Omega) = 2\Omega^3

Resulting Coefficient: A = 2

Step 2: Square and Sum
We square the coefficient found in Step 1.
Square: A^2 = 2^2 = 4

Summing over the non-zero components (diagonal and off-diagonal contribute equally):
Sum = 4 (from diagonal) + 4 (from off-diagonal) = 8

Step 3: Apply Formula
\mathcal{P} = \frac{1}{5} * Sum * (constants)
\xi = \frac{8}{5} = 1.6

Predicted Answer: [A] 1.6 (Incorrect)
