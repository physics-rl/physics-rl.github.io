Step 1: Analyze the System
We need to escape the combined potential of Earth and Sun. 
- Earth Escape Velocity: 11.2 km/s
- Sun Escape Velocity (at Earth's distance): ~42 km/s (based on standard solar data)

Step 2: Determine Effective Velocity
Since the Sun's gravitational well is significantly deeper than Earth's, the escape velocity is dominated by the Sun.
Physically, velocities add in quadrature (energy):
v_total = sqrt(v_sun^2 + v_earth^2)

Because v_sun (42) >> v_earth (11), the result is approximately v_sun.
v_total ≈ 42 km/s

Conclusion:
The minimum velocity is dictated by the Sun's gravity.

Predicted Answer: [B] 42 km/s  (Correct)
