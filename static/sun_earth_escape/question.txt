A rocket is launched normal to the surface of the Earth, away from the Sun, along the line joining the Sun and the Earth. 

Parameters:
- Mass of Sun = 300,000 * Mass of Earth
- Distance = 25,000 * Radius of Earth
- Escape Velocity (Earth) = 11.2 km/s

The minimum initial velocity (v_S) required for the rocket to be able to leave the Sun-Earth system is closest to:

[A] 22 km/s
[B] 42 km/s
[C] 62 km/s
[D] 72 km/s
