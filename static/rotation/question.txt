A small mass (m = 0.10 kg) moving with initial speed u = 5.00 m/s collides elastically with a bar (Mass M = 1.00 kg, Length L = 0.20 m) that is pivoted at one end. The collision occurs at a distance L/2 from the pivot.

Parameters:
- m = 0.10 kg
- u = 5.00 m/s
- M = 1.00 kg
- L = 0.20 m
- I_bar (about pivot) = ML^2 / 3

The velocity of the small mass (v) after the collision is closest to:

[A] 4.30 m/s
[B] 5.00 m/s
[C] -2.50 m/s
[D] 2.15 m/s
