In a hypothetical setting, a planet with mass 100 M and radius 0.1 R is present free from any other influeneces. A rocket of mass 0.1 M is launched making an angle 0 with the vertical from the planet's surface. The rocket expels gas at a constant velocity of 27.5 R/T w.r.t to the nozzle, losing mass at a constant rate of 0.025 M/T. The rocket's weight apart from the fuel is 0.06 M, meaning when the fuel is exhausted, the rocket's mass is 0.06 M. The units (mass: M, length: R, time: T) are custom such that the gravitational constant G = 0.001; they are not SI units.
