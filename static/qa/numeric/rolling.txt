<description>
A smooth plane is tilted by 0° around its local y-axis relative to the horizontal. A bowl (spherical cap cut from a sphere at arbitrary height (h <= 2r)) sits on it and is then rotated by 60° about that same y-axis so its bottom just touches the plane. It has a radius of 0.27 m. The cutout plane is at a height of 0.11 m from the center. It is placed so its curved surface just touches the plane.
