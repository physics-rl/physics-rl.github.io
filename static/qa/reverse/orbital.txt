In a planetary system, a star with mass 4.55 M and radius 0.98 R is at the center. 3 planets orbit around the star in coplanar orbits.  The planets have the following properties at a given time (lets say t=0): 
|   Planet | Mass (M)   | Radius (R)   | Position (R)   | Velocity (R/T)   |
|----------|------------|--------------|----------------|------------------|
|        1 | 0.2    | 0.05    | -0.05 1.42      | -6.07 -0.2      |
|        2 | 0.39    | 0.1    | 0.81 1.5      | -4.92 2.64      |
|        3 | 0.21    | 0.1    | x 0.44      | -0.98 -4.69      |

Assume that the star remains fixed at the center of the system, and planets do not apply any gravitational force on each other. The units (mass: M, length: R, time: T) are custom such that the gravitational constant G = 10.0; they are not SI units.
