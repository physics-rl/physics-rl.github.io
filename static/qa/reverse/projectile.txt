In a setup, a ball of mass 6.0 kg is thrown upward at an angle of 80 degrees with the horizontal. The ball is launched from an initial height of 0 m from the ground and it has an initial speed of 10 m/s. Assume that horizontal is +ve x axis and verticaly upwards in +ve y axis. The coefficient of restitution between the ball and the ground is x.
