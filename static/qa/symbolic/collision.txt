A smooth table is inclined at an angle θ_1 degrees with the horizontal. There are multiple systems on this table.
In a system called 'ComplexCollisionPlane.mass-0', a block of mass m_1 kg is placed at 1.0 m on the table. It is initially moving with a velocity of 2 m/s.
In a system called 'ComplexCollisionPlane.sphere-1', sphere of mass m_2 kg is placed at 2.5 m on the table. It is initially moving with a velocity of -0.3 m/s.
A wall is fixed at 0.0 m on the table.
In a system called 'ComplexCollisionPlane.spring_mass-3', 2 blocks are placed at 3.0 and 4.0 m on the table. They have masses m_3 and m_4 Kg respectively. These blocks are connected in series by springs (which might be initially stretched or compressed) of stiffness k_1 N/m respectively. The natural length of these springs are 1.0 respectively.
 All collisions are perfectly elastic.
