In a setup, a ball of mass m_1 kg is thrown upward at an angle of θ_1 degrees with the horizontal. The ball is launched from an initial height of y_1 m from the ground and it has an initial speed of vx_1 m/s. Assume that horizontal is +ve x axis and verticaly upwards in +ve y axis. The coefficient of restitution between the ball and the ground is e_1.
