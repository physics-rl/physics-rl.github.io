In a hypothetical setting, a planet with mass m_2 M and radius r_1 R is present free from any other influeneces. A rocket of mass m_1 M is launched making an angle θ_1 with the vertical from the planet's surface. The rocket expels gas at a constant velocity of vx_1 R/T w.r.t to the nozzle, losing mass at a constant rate of m_3 M/T. The rocket's weight apart from the fuel is m_4 M, meaning when the fuel is exhausted, the rocket's mass is m_4 M. The units (mass: M, length: R, time: T) are custom such that the gravitational constant G = 0.001; they are not SI units.
