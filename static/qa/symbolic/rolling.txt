<description>
A smooth plane is tilted by θ_1° around its local y-axis relative to the horizontal. A bowl (spherical cap cut from a sphere at arbitrary height (h <= 2r)) sits on it and is then rotated by θ_2° about that same y-axis so its bottom just touches the plane. It has a radius of r_1 m. The cutout plane is at a height of h_1 m from the center. It is placed so its curved surface just touches the plane.
