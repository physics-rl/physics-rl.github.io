<description>
In a system called 'fixed_pulley_start', a block of mass m_1 kg is suspended in the air with the help of a light string that goes over a pulley. 
The string that connects the block to an overhead pulley in 'fixed_pulley_start' extends outward  to connect to the left side of the prism in 'mass_prism_plane' after wrapping around a pulley on the left side of the plane, remaining parallel to the plane.
In a system called mass_prism_plane, a block of mass m_2 kg rests on the left side a movable prism of mass m_3 Kg. The prism makes an angle θ_1 degrees with the plane, which in turn makes an angle θ_2 degrees with horizontal.
